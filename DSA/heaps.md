# Heaps

Particular type of binary tree which are two types:

Left Child -> 2i + 1
Right Child -> 2i + 2
x = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

1) Min Heap
2) Max Heap


# Min Heap
Minimum element is the root node

Pick any node it will be always smaller than its right and left nodes

## Heap Pop
Pop Minimum Element -> Heap pop
Log base 2 N operation that needed to go down the tree aka heap pop 

## Heap Push
Insert in the Heap
Log base 2 N operation 

## Heap peek
Time Complexity -> O(N)
